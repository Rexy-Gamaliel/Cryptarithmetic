# Cryptarithmetic Solver

### Deskripsi program
A cryptarithmetic equation solver using **brute force** algorithm implemented in python

### Requirement
* Python3 installed. Please refer to the internet for the installation ;)

### How to use
1. Clone this repository to your local directory by navigating to your local directory and typing this line in the command line:
'''
git clone "https://github.com/Rexy-Gamaliel/Cryptarithmetic"
'''
1. Configure the equation you want to solve in a .txt file with the following format:
> WORDA
> WORDB
> WORDC
> ------
> RESULT
  Things to be noted:
  * Operands are to be inputted above the dash row, while a single result is to be inputted below it
  * You may input arbitrary number (> 1) of operands above the dash row
  * The number of dashes in the dash row is irrelevant
  * The equation would be intepreted as **summation** of the *operands* resulting in *result*
  * The input file is **case-sensitive**
1. Go to '''/src''' folder
1. Run the python program
